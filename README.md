# Horiseon-WC31-Graham-Gibbs
I edited the Code to make it more clean and concise. The code had a lot of unnecessary elements that didn't add to the website but just made it harder to read. Also some of the css elements were organized in a way that made no sense and didn't make sense in the order that they were organized that needed to be changed.
